    <h2>To My 9th Congress,</h2>
    <p>
     You've become more than just an organization to me - you're my second family. The laughter, tears, and countless moments of growth we've experienced together have forever changed me in ways that I'll be grateful for.

In the midst of chaos, you were my peace. Your love, support, and encouragement gave me strength when I felt weak and hopeless. Your presence in my life reminded me that I wasn't alone, that I'm part of something bigger than myself, and that I wasn't hard to love and understand.

The bond we've formed is more than just mere acquaintances; it's a deep, unbreakable connection that will stay with me forever. You've seen me at my worst and at my best, and yet, you've loved me unconditionally. You've pushed me to be my best self, to serve with passion, and to love without limits.

As we move forward in life and you find your new sense of purpose, I want you to know that you'll always be a part of me. Your stories, struggles, and achievements will forever be etched in my heart. I'll carry the lessons we've learned, the laughter we've shared, and the tears we've dried together with me wherever I go.

Thank you for being my family, my support system, and my source of strength. I love you all more than words can express. Wherever life takes us, know that our bond will remain unbroken, a testament to the love and connection we've shared. Every achievement of mine, just know that you guys were a part of making it possible.
<br>

With the biggest love,

    <h2>Sec Fionah,</h2>
    <p>FIONAURRRRR, You’ve honestly been one of the brightest, loudest, and most unforgettable people I’ve ever met — in the best way possible syempre. Your energy is infectious, your jokes are top-tier (even the corny jokes nimo), and you somehow manage to bring both chaos and comfort into every conversation we have. 

But beyond the laughter and your amazing sense of humor, there’s a side of you that not everyone always sees right away — the side that listens deeply, that overthinks sometimes because you care too much, and that carries a quiet strength behind all the noise. That’s the papart I’ve come to admire.

You’ve got this mix of being fun and fierce, but also incredibly thoughtful and grounded. You know when to turn the volume up and when to sit quietly and hold space for someone. And that balance? That maturity? It’s something I deeply respect.

You’ve made me laugh, made me feel heard, and reminded me that it’s okay to care deeply — even if it comes with a little worry. Your heart is so big, Fionah, and it’s impossible not to feel safe and seen around you.

Please don’t ever change. Keep being loud. Keep being funny. Keep worrying about people even if you pretend you’re not. It all makes you, you— and that’s someone I’m truly grateful to know. LET'S GO PAPARTTTTT</p>

    <h2>ASS. SEC JENNY</h2>
    <p>JENNYYYY, You already know this, but I just want to say it anyway — you’re one of the most badass and genuinely inspiring people I’ve met. You’re loud, funny, and full of life — but also fierce, focused, and full of heart. 

I’ve seen how much you’ve gone through — the struggles, the weight you carry, the things you never even say out loud — and yet, you’re still here. Still fighting. Still laughing. Still leading. That’s something I truly, deeply admire about you. You’re strong, Jenny. Like, really strong. And whether you see it or not, everyone around you feels it.

Also, can we just acknowledge that despite being  "gwapa gwapa ra"(matud pa ni sandrine HAHAHHAHA), we both know you’ve got more than just looks going for you. Bright kaayo ka. You’ve got the brains, the skill, the wit — and the heart to back it all up.

As you enter 10th Congress (wow, double digits na jud 😭), I just want to wish you all the love and luck in the world. I know you’re gonna handle it like you always do — head high, heart strong, and with that signature Jenny maldita look that somehow keeps everyone intrigued.

Keep pushing, keep shining, and please never lose that fire in you. You’re doing better than you think. And I’m always rooting for you.</p>

    <h2>Graphic Designer Richard</h2>
    <p>TO OUR GRAPHIC ORGANIZER, I want to take a moment to truly appreciate the incredible skills and qualities you bring to everything you do. Your talent in graphic designing and editing is SUPER WOWWWW.

Beyond your skills, what makes you truly special is the way you carry yourself. You may be quiet and reserved at first, but you have this wonderful sense of humor that catches people by surprise — always lightening the mood and bringing genuine smiles to those around you when we actually get close to you. Your jolly spirit, even in subtle ways, is contagious and admirable, and it adds warmth to every interaction.

What I also want to highlight is your empathy. You have an incredible ability to listen and understand others, to pick up on feelings that aren’t always spoken aloud. It’s a rare gift that makes you not only a great colleague but a trusted friend. Your kindness and thoughtfulness create an environment where people feel safe and supported, and that’s truly invaluable.

In many ways, you’re the perfect balance — calm and mahinhin on the outside, but with a quiet energy and a heart that cares deeply. You let your work and your actions speak louder than words, and it’s clear to anyone who knows you that you bring so much more than just talent to the table.

It’s been an absolute pleasure to work with you and getting to know you better even though we got truly acquainted pag second sem na. I’m excited to see where your skills and your heart will take you next because you have all the tools to achieve great things. GOOD LUCK RICHARDIEEEEEE! ILYYYYYYY</p>

    <h2>Layout Artist Hannah</h2>
    <p>Hi HANNAUR, a little appreciation message for being the amazing person that you are.

You’ve always been that loud, funny soul who brings instant energy wherever you go. Like, you don't even have to try — your presence alone already livens up the whole room. Whether it’s you cracking a joke, teasing someone, labaw nas papart HAHAHHAH, or just being your usual bibo self, you’ve got this charm that’s hard to ignore.

But beyond all that fun and chaos you bring sa congress, what I love most about you is your heart. You’re one of the most real, down-to-earth people I know. There’s no plinastikay with you. What you see is what you get — and what you get is someone who’s genuinely kind, thoughtful, and always looking out for others, even if you don’t make a big deal out of it.

And how you manage to be loud and innocent at the same time. You’re out here making everyone laugh their hearts out one minute, then being the most caring ate the next. You’re lowkey matured in ways most people overlook — you feel deeply, you listen, and you notice when people aren’t okay. That softness in you, that care — it’s one of the reasons people feel safe around you. Take care and good luck with college, Hannah! I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU (SORRY NA KANI IMO PIC, WA JD KO KITAG PIC NA KITA DUHA JADBVJADBVK)</p>

    <h2>CBT CHAIRPERSON MATT</h2>
    <p>	HI PAPA MATT! Let me just say it straight: THANK YOU KAAYO. For everything. For showing up, for being one of the hearts and souls sa CSO, and for always being there for all of us, in ways that really mattered.

You’ve been more than just our CBT Chairperson. You’ve been a safe space. A hype man. A mentor. A friend. And yeah — a whole papa figure sa among tanan 😭 From the serious things to the most random, chaotic ideas we come up with, you were always the one who said, “Go lang, as long as malipay mo.”  And it meant so much more than you probably know.

You always brought so much joy and good energy into the room — like, it’s impossible not to feel lighter when you’re around. But what makes you even more admirable is that you saw beyond the laughter. you saw the nights we were tired.

You made all of us feel like we mattered. That our voices were heard. That our happiness was valid. And honestly, that’s what made this org feel like home. That’s because of you.

The 9th Congress wouldn’t have been what it was without you. I don’t even want to imagine it without your big heart, pushing us forward, and holding us together. We laughed, cried, argued (sometimes 😅), but through it all, you stayed. You gave so much of yourself — and I just hope you know how deeply grateful I am.

Thank you, Matt. For the constant reassurance. For checking up on us. For reminding us that we’re capable. And most of all, for loving the org and the people in it the way you did.

Your voice?? Literal chills jd permi. You’re insanely talented and it’s always a privilege to hear you sing — even if it’s just you casually belting something random like naa kas concert HAHHAHAHA.

But beyond the loud laughs, powerful voice, and unfiltered nimo na mga iingon, I just want to say how much I appreciate your heart. You’re one of the most genuine people I know- just pure, honest Maria. And I love that about you.

Also, let’s not forget — masakiton twins jd ta😭 We really out here surviving life one ubo at a time HAHAHAHAHA. It’s weirdly comforting to know someone else gets it — like, we can laugh about the pain (literally) and still push through together. And I see that in you — you’ve been through so much, but you still show up with laughter, strength, and love. That’s something not a lot of people can do.

So thank you — for the realness, for the energy, for the love, and for the voice that honestly deserves maabot sa the voice kids. You’ve made this journey so much more memorable just by being in it. Keep being your loud, funny, soft-hearted self — you’re unforgettable, Maria.

Okay let’s just put it out there — yes, you’re pretty. Like, SO pretty. But let’s also be real: you’re also one of the weirdest people I know... in the best, most chaotic way possible 😭

You’ve got this supermodel face pero the moment you open your mouth, it’s either something completely random, oddly specific, or very weirdo ang peg HAHAHHAHA— pero that’s why we love you. You’re the perfect mix of grace and weirdo energy. And somehow, it works.

I’ll never understand how someone can go from Miss Universe ang wosh to sending the most cursed memes or making the most weird facial expressions mid-conversation. You're a walking plot twist, and honestly? Life would be so boring without your weirdness.

But jokes aside — I really appreciate your presence. You bring so much light and laughter to everyone around you. You’re funny, kind, and genuinely just so fun to be with. You don’t even have to try — people just gravitate toward you because of your energy (and yeah... your face card pd).

So please never change. Stay stunning, stay weird, and keep being thegirlie who can slay a runway one moment and be a total weirdo the next. I LOVE YOU MY DANCERIST, REFILM NATO ANG GNARLY HAAAAAAA</p>

    <h2>Governor Karen</h2>
    <p>GOVVVVV, First of all… thank you — for being more than just a council governor or a SocCom kauban sa church, but someone I genuinely trust and deeply appreciate. You’ve always been this calm, mahinhin presence, but what makes you even more iconic is your facial expressions that literally say what you’re thinking before you even talk 😭 Like legit, no need for subtitles… your face IS the subtitle HAHAHAHAHA. And honestly, it’s one of my favorite things about you.

Even with that quiet nature, you’ve always made your presence felt — in the way you support, in the way you listen, and in the way you show up for people. You’re the kind of person who doesn’t need to be loud to make an impact. And I’ve felt that especially in one of my lowest moments — that time I got rushed to Mendero and everything felt like a blur.

You were there. Quiet and steady, but present. I can’t explain how much that meant to me. I felt guilty when you started crying sa ambulance, I hope you don't blame yourself for what happened to me, gov. Just knowing someone like you had my back — someone I trust, someone familiar, someone who genuinely cared — made everything feel a little less scary that day, I'm sorry I wasn't able to show you my gratitude that time. You being there gave me comfort I didn’t even realize I needed at the time.

From our SocCom days, where you taught me the basics and running together to take pics, to watching you grow into this incredible leader in the council, I’ve always looked up to you. But more than the titles and roles, what I admire most is your heart. You care so much — and that care shows in everything you do, whether it’s in the work or just in being there for a friend in need.

Thank you for being a constant, for your quiet strength, and for the laughter we’ve shared (especially the times when we try not to show our subtitles sa nawng... but your face already gave it away 😭). You’ve left a mark not just in the council or the org, but in my life. I LOVE YOU GOV KAREN!!!</p>

    <p>SANDRINEEEE, first of all… bucket ka ganyan? charet HAHAHHAHAHA you’re weird in the most questionable ways, sooo obsessed with yourself (o lage gwapo na lagi ka). I swear, if ang mang sungog kay contest, winner naka.

But despite all the chaos and comedy you bring into every room (and every group chat nato 😭), what most people don’t always see — and what I’m grateful to know — is your heart.

Behind all the noise, jokes, and "tan-aw-a ko" moments, you’re actually one of the most mature and emotionally aware people I know. You carry so much, and you worry a lot — not just about yourself, but about the people you care about. And that says a lot about the kind of person you truly are.

You may be the clown sa congress, but you’re also the one who notices when someone’s off. You listen, you care, and you try your best to make people feel seen — even if it means covering it up with jokes just to make them smile. That’s a kind of love not everyone knows how to give, but you do it naturally.

So yes, you’re loud. You’re weird. You love your own face a little too much 😩. But you’re also thoughtful, self-aware, and full of heart — and I honestly wouldn’t change a thing about you. You bring color to every space you’re in, and we’re all better (and more entertained) because of it.

Thank you for the laughs, the noise, the weirdness — and most of all, for the quiet care behind it all. GOOD LUCK WITH COLLEGE DRINE, PAG BAG-O NA HAHAHAHAHHAHAH</p>

You’ve got this energy that’s equal parts chaotic and brilliant. One second you're being the funny one, making everyone laugh with the most random comments and jokes — and then the next moment you're explaining something smart that leaves us all like, “Hala, bright diay ni siya na pagka grade 7 oh", joke HAHAHHAHAHA.

It’s been such a joy being around you — your small but mighty presence always leaves an impression, and I really admire how you carry both your humor and your intellect so effortlessly. You’re weird in the best possible way, and I hope you never change that.

Also!! I just wanna say — I’m super excited na muadto kag Japan. I know it's a big step, but if there’s anyone who can thrive and take on a whole new world with confidence, it’s you. So go chase that dream, take your weird laugh with you, and show the world what you're made of. LABYU ZELLL

Yes, you’re conyo. Like very. IADMIT NANA JAHAILE!!!  But honestly? That’s your trademark.Bisan usahay samokan ka (and you know it HAHAHA), it’s always the fun kind. You bring the right kind of energy — the one that makes people laugh, feel light, and enjoy the moment.

But beyond the athlete-slash-tiktoker-slash-CSO pride identity, you’ve shown us what it means to be grounded. You never let the titles or recognition get to your head — instead, you kept showing up for the org, the team, and the people around you with humility and good vibes (and endless samok2).

You’ve made the 9th Congress experience so much more fun and memorable just by being your samokan, driven, slightly conyo self. So thank you — for being you.

Your sense of humor — sobra ka sungogan pareha ni Sandrine — usahay di na ko kasabot kung magkatawa ba ko or sapoton because it’s just so unexpected. Pero that’s exactly why you’re one of the most fun people to be around. You bring that unique, offbeat energy that lightens up even the most boring moments.

Pero aside from being this weird and funny dude, naa pud kay heart that's very caring towards everyone. You’re the type of friend nga maski sungogan or mag joke-joke, naa gihapon kay time para maminaw ug motabang kung kinsa man nang nanginahanglan. You’re like the silent type of caring — dili kaayo showy pero sure ka nga naa ra diha para nimo.

That mix of sungogan humor and genuine concern is honestly rare, and I feel lucky nga naa ka sa life nako. You can crack the funniest jokes, but you can also be serious when it really matters. Mao na, you balance things out perfectly — dili ka boring, pero dili sad ka sobra ka serious.

Thank you for always being your weird, caring, and sungogan self. You make life lighter and better just by being around, and I hope you know how much you’re appreciated. Don’t ever change that unique mix of imong personalidad, kay that’s exactly what makes you, you.

Ikaw ang eldest sa congress, pero honestly, you’re the most babied one HAHAHAHHAHA. Murag di ka jud makatakas sa pagka-princess nimo diri sa council — but that’s part of your charm. You have this crazy energy that fills every room, and you do it all with a heart full of care.

What I really appreciate about you, though, is that even if you’re loud, shameless, and full of energy, you’re also deeply caring when it counts. You’re the type to check up on friends when they’re down, to listen when someone needs to talk, and to be there even if you don’t always show it in the usual way. You know when to turn off the spotlight and just be genuinely present for people — and that’s something not everyone can do.

You remind us all that being unapologetically yourself — loud, proud, and yes, even a little extra — can go hand in hand with real care and loyalty. So keep shining, keep posting those thirst traps, but never forget that your heart is just as big as your personality. I LOVE YOU LI, TANAW NYA TA WICKED PART 2 HA WATCH OUT</p>
